# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning Python from beginner to object-oriented programming (OOP), including exercises and mini projects.

## Topics Covered
- Python basics (variables, input, conditions, loops)
- Functions
- Lists & dictionaries
- File handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Mini projects

## Project Structure

## How to Run
Make sure Python is installed, then run any file using: 
'''bash
python filename.py

Yes, this goes inside 'README.md'
It tells people how to run your python files

---

## Why it looks like code
- 'bash' just means: "this is a terminal command"
- It does **not** execute
- It's only for display on GitHub

---

## Final checklist
- 'README.md' contains **text + examples**
- No Python code will run from it
- GitHub will format it nicely

---

## Next step
After saving 'README.md' : '''bat
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README with run instructions"
git push
